Flappy Bird Enhanced
An enhanced version of the classic Flappy Bird game built using Java and Swing. This project adds several exciting features like a day/night cycle, cloud animations, and a lives system for an immersive gaming experience.

Features
Smooth Bird Animation: The bird flaps its wings while flying.
Clouds: Animated clouds move across the screen.
Day/Night Mode: Background switches between day and night every 10 points scored.
Obstacles: Two scrolling pipes challenge the player's reflexes.
Lives System: Start with 3 lives; the game ends when all lives are lost.
Score Tracking: Points are awarded for passing obstacles.
Game Over and Restart: A restart option lets you try again without restarting the application.
How to Play
Press the spacebar to make the bird jump.
Avoid colliding with the pipes and the ground.
Survive for as long as possible while scoring points.
If all lives are lost, press Enter to restart the game.
